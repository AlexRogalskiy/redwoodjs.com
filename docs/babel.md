# Babel

Redwood comes with babel configured out of the box so that you can write modern JavaScript and TypeScript without needing to worry about transpilation at all.
GraphQL tags, JSX, SVG imports‚Äîall of it's handled for you.

For those well-versed in babel config, you can view all the config that we load by default in [@redwoodjs/internal](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/packages/internal/src/build/babel). Things are organized by side.

## Configuring Babel

For most projects, you won't need to configure babel at all, but if you need to you can configure each side (web, api) individually using `babel.config.js` files.

> **Heads up**
>
> `.babelrc{.js}` files are ignored. You have to place your custom configuration in the appropriate file in `web/babel.config.js` web side and/or `api/babel.config.js` for the api side

Let's go over an example.

#### Example: Adding Emotion

Let's say we want to add the styling library [emotion](https://emotion.sh), which requires adding a babel plugin.

1. Create a `babel.config.js` file in `web`: 
```shell
touch web/babel.config.js
```
<br />

2. Add the `@emotion/babel-plugin` as a dependency: 
```shell
yarn workspace web add --dev @emotion/babel-plugin
```
<br />

3. Add the emotion plugin to your web-side babel config:
```js
// web/babel.config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: ["@emotion"] // üëà add the emotion plugin
}

// ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notice how we don't need the `extends` property
```

Your custom web-side babel configuration gets merged in with Redwood's default config.
