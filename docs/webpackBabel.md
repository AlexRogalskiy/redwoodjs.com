# Webpack & Babel Configuration

One of Redwood's tenets is convention over configuration, so it's worth repeating that you don't have to do any of this!
Take the golden path and everything will work just fine.

But another of Redwood's tenets is to make the hard stuff possible.

Whether configuring webpack and babel counts as hard-stuff or not is up for debate, but one thing we know for sure is that it can be an epic time sink.

We hope that documenting it well makes it fast and easy.

## Configuring Babel

### Default configations
Redwood by default configures all the required babel plugins so you can write modern JavaScript and TypeScript without needing to worry about transpilation at all. GraphQL tags, JSX, SVG imports are all handled for you.

For those well versed in babel config, you can view all the config that we load by default: [@redwoodjs/internal babel config](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/packages/internal/src/build/babel)

### Bringing your own babel plugins
For most projects, you may not need to configure any babel plugins at all, but if you wish to you can configure each of the sides individually using `babel.config.js` files.

Definitely check the [setup command](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands#setup) on the Redwood CLI first, as we may have commands to setup certain libraries for you!

> **Heads up**
>
> `.babelrc{.js}` files are ignored. You have to place your custom configuration in the appropriate file in `web/babel.config.js` web side and/or `api/babel.config.js` for the api side

Let's demonstrate this by example

#### Example: adding Emotion to Redwood
Let's say we want to add the styling library [emotion](https://emotion.sh), which requires adding a babel plugin.

1. Create a custom babel config file: `./web/babel.config.js`
<br/>
2. Install the `emotion/babel-plugin` as a dependency: `yarn add --dev @emotion/babel-plugin`
3. Add the emotion plugin, to your web side babel config:

```js
// web/babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["@emotion"] // üëà add the emotion plugin
}

// ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notice how we do not need the "extends" property
```
<br/>

Your configuration for your Redwood web side will now be merged in with the default config.


## Configuring Webpack

The best way to start configuring webpack is with the webpack setup command:

```bash
yarn rw setup webpack
```

This command adds a file called `webpack.config.js` to your project's `web/config` directory, creating `web/config` if it doesn't exist:

```js
// web/config/webpack.config.js

module.exports = (config, { mode }) => {
  if (mode === 'development') {
    /**
     * Add a development-only plugin
     */
  }

  /**
   * Add custom rules and plugins:
   *
   * ```
   * config.module.rules.push(YOUR_RULE)
   * config.plugins.push(YOUR_PLUGIN)
   * ```
   */

  /**
   * And make sure to return the config!
   */
  return config
}
```

This file exports a function that gets passed two arguments: `config`, which is Redwood's webpack configuration, and an object with the property `mode`, which is either `'development'` or `'production'`.

In this function, you can add custom rules and plugins or modify Redwood's webpack configuration, which you can find in `@redwoodjs/core`.
Redwood has a common webpack configuration that gets merged with others depending on your project's environment (i.e. development or production):
- [webpack.common.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/core/config/webpack.common.js)‚Äîthe common configuration; does most of the leg work
- [webpack.development.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/core/config/webpack.development.js)‚Äîused when you start the dev server (`yarn rw dev`)
- [webpack.production.js](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/core/config/webpack.production.js)‚Äîused when you build the web side (`yarn rw build web`)

### Sass

Redwood comes configured with support for Sass‚Äîall you have to do is install dependencies:

```bash
yarn workspace web add -D sass sass-loader
```

### Tailwind CSS

Configuring webpack just to use Tailwind CSS? Don't! Use the setup command instead:

```
yarn rw setup tailwind
```

## Webpack Dev Server

Redwood uses [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) for local development.
When you run `yarn rw dev`, TOML keys in your `redwood.toml`'s `[web]` table, like `port` and `apiUrl`, are used as Webpack Dev Server options (in this case, [devServer.port](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverport) and [devServer.proxy](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverproxy) respectively).

### Passing options with `--forward`

While you can configure Webpack Dev Server in `web/config/webpack.config.js`, it's often simpler to just pass options straight to `yarn rw dev` using the `--forward` flag.

> For the full list of Webpack Dev Server options, see https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/.

#### Example: Setting the Port and Disabling Browser Opening

In addition to passing new options, you can override those in your `redwood.toml`:

```bash
yarn rw dev --forward="--port 1234 --no-open"
```

This starts your project on port `1234` and disables automatic browser opening.

#### Example: Allow External Host Access

If you're running Redwood in dev mode and trying to test your application from an external source (i.e. outside your network), you'll get an ‚ÄúInvalid Host Header‚Äù. To enable this workflow, run the following:

```bash
yarn rw dev --forward="--allow-hosts example.company.com --host 0.0.0.0"
```

This starts your project and forwards it to `example.company.com`.
